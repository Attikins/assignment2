really happening in a company based on the database information. &nbsp;Lee has also rolled out numerous upgrades to IT infrastructure and been responsible for training staff in new application and software. &nbsp;She was first exposed to </span><span>computers through playing 80s adventure games with friends in primary school, and as technology improved her curiosity and involvement with technology has only increased. &nbsp;Being a teenager when floppy discs and dial up internet were still a thing, Lee sees that the world of IT has evolved so vastly and there&#39;s so much more to learn, and she wants to learn as much about it as she can. </span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Being that technology and computers have been a part of her life for so long, it&#39;s no great surprise that Lee is an avid gamer in her spare time, which is somewhat limited these days as she&rsquo;s also looking after her young family while working part time. &nbsp;Alongside video games she also enjoys playing netball and learning more about the world through listening to any number of the shows in her massive podcast library. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr

Eventually his natural curiosity for learning crossed paths with IT in the form of his family&rsquo;s first computer. &nbsp;Nathan realised that computers were not magic, but machines, that could be understood and mastered. &nbsp;He has followed this curiosity with IT &nbsp;to a career in electronics, and plans to continue building on his insatiable quest for understanding by studying his Bachelor of Information Technology. &nbsp;Already being involved in electronics through his career, Nathan has many ideas for IT based projects and hope through further study he could bring these to fruition. &nbsp;His strong desire to always improve and master his skills has also been applied to his many and varied other interests which include archery, playing music professionally, being a Kung Fu Master, and being able to solve a rubik&rsquo;s cube! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c6">Nicholas Young</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c21">RMIT Student # </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Title: Game designer / Tenacious Self Learner &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Young in name and in age, but don&rsquo;t let that deceive you. &nbsp;After completing high school Nicholas continued to pursue his interest in IT and studied both IT Networking and Level Design, and it currently studying his Bachelor of IT at RMIT. &nbsp;

(his own words) &nbsp;to learn more about the craft around his passion. &nbsp;Fast forward to today and Cory passion about game design has only increased. &nbsp;Cory sees the potential for 3D art and design to be better and bolder, and he sees his current studies with RMIT as a big step towards learning more about his passion. &nbsp;His other main interests &nbsp;which he also approaches with passion and creativity are coffee and metal music. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c6">Harrison Williams</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">RMIT Student # s3791005</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Title: &nbsp;Coder &amp;
